# Mini projects 

As a second year Data Science student at Northumbria Uinversity, I am still actively learning and progressing in my programming languages and ability to create projects everyday. As it is such a strong passion of mine - data analysis, the science and programming behind it - combining it with the creative, problem solving aspect of it, I am constantly learning and studying it in my free time as well to gain a better understanding and to progress even further. Here is some of my mini projects i learn how to create using my knowledge from others and my studies.
